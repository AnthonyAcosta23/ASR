Creating a full-fledged call center program with speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities is beyond the scope of a simple code snippet.
However, I can provide you with a basic Python script using the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries to get you started. This will allow the program to listen to the agent's speech and respond back using text-to-speech.

Please note that this is a minimal example, and a production-level call center system would require additional functionalities and robust error handling.
